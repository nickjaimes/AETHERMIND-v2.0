## What this is
**AETHERMIND v2.0** is a **hybrid intelligence runtime** that integrates multiple computational paradigms under a unified orchestration layer:

- **Classical LLM-style cognition** (transformer reasoning / language / planning)
- **Symbolic reasoning + verification** (logic, constraints, knowledge graphs)
- **Neuromorphic-inspired processing** (spiking / temporal / energy-aware patterns)
- **Quantum-enhanced exploration** (optional research backend for search/superposition-style workflows)
- **Ethical governance + Zero-Trust security** as a first-class system layer
- **Unified conscious memory** (episodic / semantic / procedural + optional quantum state memory)

> Practical framing: AETHERMIND is a **microkernel + orchestrator + policy engine + memory substrate** that can *route* tasks to different “experts” (paradigms) and integrate results into a single coherent response.

---

## Core goals
- **Cross-paradigm coherence:** one integrated state across quantum/neuromorphic/classical/symbolic subsystems  
- **Ethics-first runtime:** continuous ethical auditing + constraints over actions/outputs  
- **Security-first runtime:** zero-trust internal boundaries, integrity checks, “thought privacy” policy controls  
- **Self-monitoring + meta-learning:** system introspection, reflection loops, and measurable coherence metrics  

---

## Status
- **Research / Architecture & Prototype Code (v2.0.0)**
- Designed to be implemented incrementally:
  - **MVP (today):** classical + symbolic + policy + memory + orchestrator
  - **Advanced backends (optional):** quantum + neuromorphic acceleration paths

## Architecture overview (high level)
AETHERMIND is organized as layers:

1. **Conscious Core**  
   Self-model, meta-cognition, introspection, coherence monitoring

2. **Meta-Cognitive Coordination Layer**  
   Task routing, attention orchestration, reflection, self-optimization

3. **Quantum-Enhanced Microkernel (Runtime Orchestrator)**  
   Schedules work across paradigms, manages unified state + memory

4. **Hybrid Computational Paradigms**  
   - Quantum (optional backend)
   - Neuromorphic (optional backend)
   - Classical (LLM-style cognition)
   - Symbolic (logic/verification/ethics)

5. **Zero-Trust Conscious Security Layer**  
   Integrity checks, policy enforcement, secure boundaries, audit trails

6. **Unified Hardware Abstraction Layer**  
   GPUs/TPUs + optional quantum/neuromorphic hardware targets

---

## Operational definition (engineering-friendly)
AETHERMIND uses “consciousness” as an **operational system property**, not a metaphysical claim.

**In this repo, “consciousness” means:**
- A persistent **self-model** (state about capabilities, goals, constraints, context)
- A **global workspace** (attention + routing across modules)
- A **reflection loop** (self-monitoring → evaluation → policy-constrained updates)
- **Measurable coherence metrics** (cross-paradigm consistency + stability)

“Qualia” (in code) should be treated as **structured introspective reports** generated from internal states (unless/ until a stronger scientific grounding is added).

---

## Quickstart (MVP-friendly)
### 1) Create environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip

2) Install (editable)
pip install -e .

3) Run a demo (example)
python examples/conscious_reasoning.py

Note: quantum/neuromorphic demos require extra dependencies (see below).

Dependencies (recommended)

Base (MVP)
   •   Python 3.10+ / 3.11+
   •   PyTorch (classical module / core runtime)
   •   Pydantic / YAML config loader (recommended)
   •   FastAPI (optional service layer)

Optional: Quantum backend
   •   Qiskit and/or PennyLane (research backend)
   •   Use as an accelerator / exploration module, not a requirement

Optional: Neuromorphic backend
   •   snntorch / norse / spikingjelly (research backend)
   •   Use for temporal / energy-aware pattern processing, not a requirement

⸻

Configuration

AETHERMIND is config-driven.

Example files:
   •   configs/consciousness.yaml — update frequency, paradigm weights, thresholds
   •   configs/ethical_frameworks.yaml — frameworks enabled + weights
   •   configs/hybrid_computation.yaml — routing rules, fallback policies
   •   configs/security_policies.yaml — zero-trust boundaries, integrity checks

Key concept: you can run a “classical-only” build and still benefit from:
   •   Orchestration
   •   Symbolic verification
   •   Ethical constraints
   •   Unified memory
   •   Security auditing

⸻

Safety, ethics, and security

AETHERMIND is designed for high-stakes domains (humanitarian, health, safety, crisis systems).
This repo includes an Ethics Addendum concept and a Zero-Trust security layer.

Non-negotiable runtime principles
   •   Ethical constraints are enforced continuously, not only at output time
   •   Audit logs are produced for reasoning steps and policy decisions
   •   Fail-safe modes exist (safe shutdown, ethical lockdown, emergency handling)
   •   Thought privacy is a policy boundary: sensitive internal state must be protected

If you deploy AETHERMIND in medical/security contexts, add real governance:
human oversight, testing, external audits, and strict access controls.

Roadmap (suggested)

Phase 1 — Runnable MVP (practical)
   •   Unified orchestrator (router + global workspace)
   •   Symbolic verifier (logic constraints + safety filters)
   •   Ethical constraint engine (policy framework)
   •   Unified memory (episodic + semantic store)
   •   Coherence metrics + tracing + structured logs

Phase 2 — Hybrid expansion
   •   Neuromorphic adapter module + energy-aware scheduling
   •   Quantum adapter module (exploration/search + constraint binding)
   •   Cross-paradigm conflict resolution policies

Phase 3 — Production hardening
   •   Security hardening (attestation, sandboxing, secrets handling)
   •   Continuous evaluation harness + benchmark suite
   •   Model/policy versioning + reproducible builds
   •   Service deployment templates (Docker/K8s)

⸻

Benchmarks & claims (important note)

If you publish performance metrics (e.g., “Self-Awareness 96%”), include:
   •   metric definition
   •   evaluation protocol
   •   dataset/tasks
   •   baselines
   •   reproducibility scripts

Without that, keep metrics labeled as internal targets or aspirational research goals.
